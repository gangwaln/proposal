\begin{itemize}
\item $H_0$: null hypothesis, the statement of what we assumed to be true, eg. $X$, $Y$ are independent. \\
\item $H_a$:  alternative hypothesis, statement against the null hypothesis, eg. $X$, $Y$ are not independent. \\
\item test statistic:  plot of observed data.  \\
\item sampling distribution:  distribution of the test statistic, the plot of the observed data. Hence the lineup is the sampling distribution.\\
\item null distribution: distribution where the null datasets are sampled from.\\
\item Significance level $\alpha$:  $\alpha \in (0,1)$ is the threshold at which we will reject the null hypothesis, should the $p$-value fall under it, usually $\alpha=0.05$.\\
\item test procedure:  a set of $K$ independent judges evaluates a lineup of size $m$ to come to a conclusion whether to reject $H_0$.\\
\item $p$-value:  probability that $x$ or more of $K$ observers pick the data plot under $H_0$. \\
\item power:  probability to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.\\
\item type I error:  probability to reject the null hypothesis if it is true\\
\item type II error:  probability to fail to reject the null hypothesis if it is false\\

%\item \textbf{Sampling Distribution}: The sampling distribution is the distribution of the sample statistic based on all possible samples of sample size $n$ from the population. So we have a population of size 30 and we take samples of size 5, there are $c^{30}_5$ possible samples from the population. If we calculate the mean of all the samples and draw a histogram, the histogram gives the sampling distribution of the sample mean.
%\item \textbf{Null Distribution}: The null distribution corresponds to the probability distribution of the test statistic when the null hypothesis is true. So if we want to test for the means, \\
%
%$H_0: \mu = 0$ vs $H_a: \mu \ne 0$\\
%
%the test statistic is given by \\
%
%$$t=\frac{\bar{X} - 0}{S/\sqrt{n}}$$\\
%
%The distribution of the test statistic $t$ when $H_0$ is true is a central $t$ distribution with (n - 1) degrees of freedom. This is the null distribution of the test statistic $t$.
\end{itemize}

\centerline{\bf\large Some other terms}

\begin{itemize}
\item projection pursuit: an algorithm to find the most interesting low dimensional projections of a high dimensional data by optimizing a predetermined criterion function called projection pursuit index.
\item penalized discriminant analysis (PDA) index: a projection pursuit index specifically designed to tackle the large $p$, small $n$ problems, an improvement to LDA index.
\item wilk's $\Lambda$: is given by $$\Lambda=\frac{|W|}{|W + B|}$$ where $W$ and $B$ are the within-group and between-group sum of squares respectively.
\end{itemize}
