\item \textbf{Sampling Distribution}: The sampling distribution is the distribution of the sample statistic based on all possible samples of sample size $n$ from the population. So we have a population of size 30 and we take samples of size 5, there are $c^{30}_5$ possible samples from the population. If we calculate the mean of all the samples and draw a histogram, the histogram gives the sampling distribution of the sample mean.
\item \textbf{Null Distribution}: The null distribution corresponds to the probability distribution of the test statistic when the null hypothesis is true. So if we want to test for the means, \\

$H_0: \mu = 0$ vs $H_a: \mu \ne 0$\\

the test statistic is given by \\

$$t=\frac{\bar{X} - 0}{S/\sqrt{n}}$$\\

The distribution of the test statistic $t$ when $H_0$ is true is a central $t$ distribution with (n - 1) degrees of freedom. This is the null distribution of the test statistic $t$.
